### **Introduction**

This project uses a Neural Network (NN) called ShipTrainer, to control a spaceship navigating through a scrolling tunnel autonomously. The main goal is for the NN to keep the ship flying without hitting the tunnel walls for at least 30 seconds, showcasing effective AI control of the ship.
